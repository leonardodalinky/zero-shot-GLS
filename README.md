This repo is the official implementation of NAACL'24 paper "[Zero-shot Generative Linguistic Steganography](https://aclanthology.org/2024.naacl-long.289/)".

## Setup

1. Create Conda environment and install the requirements:
```shell
conda create -n zgls python=3.10
conda activate zgls
#
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install auto-gptq --extra-index-url https://huggingface.github.io/autogptq-index/whl/cu121/
```
2. Compile external Python module:
```shell
pip install external_tools/zgls-utils
```
3. Install pre-commit hooks:
```shell
pre-commit install
```
4. Create a temp folder in HDD for storing and sharing files, for example:
```shell
# DO NOT copy directly!
mkdir -p $SHARE_FOLDER/zgls
ln -s $SHARE_FOLDER/zgls tmp_saves
ln -s $SHARE_FOLDER/datasets/imdb datasets/imdb
ln -s $SHARE_FOLDER/datasets/twitter datasets/twitter
```

    abstract = "Generative linguistic steganography attempts to hide secret messages into covertext. Previous studies have generally focused on the statistical differences between the covertext and stegotext, however, ill-formed stegotext can readily be identified by humans. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot approach based on in-context learning for linguistic steganography to achieve better perceptual and statistical imperceptibility. We also design several new metrics and reproducible language evaluations to measure the imperceptibility of the stegotext. Our experimental results indicate that our method produces $1.926\times$ more innocent and intelligible stegotext than any other method.",
