# SAAC

Here is the adaption of the original implementation of [mickeysjm/StegaText](https://github.com/mickeysjm/StegaText).

This method only use **pretrained GPT2** and requires **no training**. In the original paper, only the first three sentences of the covertext is used as the context for conditional text generation. The secret bits are then fed to the text generation for stego-text.

We DO NOT use the bit encoding of the original repo, since we already have the encoded bits.

# StegaText

This repo contains the implementations of several linguistic steganography methods in paper "Near-imperceptible Neural Linguistic Steganography via Self-Adjusting Arithmetic Coding" published in EMNLP 2020.

## Dependency

You need to install all dependent librarys in `requirements.txt` file. Besides, you need to download the `gpt2-medium` model (345M parameter) from [transformers library](https://huggingface.co/transformers/pretrained_models.html)

## Datasets

We put all four datasets mentioned in the paepr into the `datasets/` folder.


## Included Implementations

1. `block_baseline.py`: implementations of baseline method `Bin-LM` in the paper.
2. `huffman_baseline.py`: implementations of baseline method `RNN-Stega` in the paper.
3. `arithmetic_baseline.py`: implementations of baseline method `Arithmetic` in the paper.
4. `saac.py`: implementations of our proposed method `SAAC` in the paper.

## How to run

You can run all steganography methods in two modes:

1. `run_single_end2end.py`: a script to run though the entire steganography pipeline (i.e., encryption -> encoding -> decoding -> decryption) on `one plaintext`.
2. `run_batch_encode.py`: a script to run the encryption+encoding steps on `a batch of plaintexts`.

Example commands are included in `run_all.sh`.
