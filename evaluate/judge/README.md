# Human-like Judgement by ChatGPT

We use ChatGPT to perform human-like judgement over the generated stego-text.

The evaluation includes 3 parts:
* Soundness: whether the text is logically sound
* Relevance: whether the text is relevant to the given topic
* Engagingness: whether the text is engaging to the readers

Before running the evaluation, OpenAI API token must be set in the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
